PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  
This introductory project taught me how to work with DataLab notebooks and utilize them to solve DataCamp projects. I learned about notebooks and cells and how to use them to address problems in Python, SQL, and R projects. This prepared me to tackle my first real notebook-based project!

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  
What makes a name timeless or trendy? In this project, I used data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration spanning over a hundred years to understand American baby name tastes.
The ranking, grouping, joining, ordering, and pattern matching skills I used in this project are broadly applicable: understanding changing tastes is a key competency for businesses as well as parents searching for a baby name!
